        <p>Ever tried Bits and Bites? Some people may know them under a different name: Nuts and Bolts. But they are a pretty tasty snack that, surprisingly,
        probably doesnt contribute much to North Americas obesity epidemic! This baked snack food comes with a variety of combinations, depending on the brand. 
        Locally, they can be purchased with an assortment of wheat squares, cheese bits crackers, pretzels, and toasted o's</p>

<!--Hope no one minded my obesity joke. Steps and ingredients here-->
    <h3>What about making these bad boys from home?</h3>
        <p>Well, its pretty simple! Gather up a nice supply of the aforementioned goods, then grab yourself a big roasting pan and finally, a few choice ingredients as below:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 lb of butter</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons Garlic Powder</li>
            <li>2 Tablespoons Onion Powder</li>
            <li>1 Tablespoon Salt</li>
            <li>1 Tablespoon Chili Powder</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Now that thats done, how do we make this godly treat?</h3>
        <p>well, preheat your oven to 250. Mix the goods. Then mix the goods in the list separately. Finally, toss em together and mix everything up so your ingredients are evenly coated. 
        One youve done that, stick em in the over for about 2 hours or so and bam, literal crack. Try not to eat them all in one sitting, that would be bad. Wanna kick it up a notch?
        Hit up your local <a href="https://www.bulkbarn.ca/" target="_blank">Bulk Barn</a>, or comparable business for some cheddar powder type stuff and throw in 2 or so tbsp of that too.</p>
