    <h2>Decently Yummy Burgers</h2>
    <h5><a href="../index.html">Back to main page</a></h5>
    <p>So, ever go over to a buddies for BBQ burgers and he/she hands you a plate <em>just crumbles?</em> Kinda like a sad little pile of loose ground beef, but with some chunks? 
    Or maybe it just gets split in half real funny and then loses a small chunk of the side somewhere? Me too. </p>
    <h3>Too. Damn. Often.</h3>
    <h5>Or maybe my friends are just idiots.</h5>
    <h3>Well, Im gonna tell you how to avoid that with these simple ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 lb Ground Beef</li>
        <li>1 Egg, Beaten</li>
        <li>3/4 Cup Dried Breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>3 tbps Evaporated Milk</li>
        <li>2 tbps Worcestershire Sauce</li>
        <li>1/8 tbps Cayenne Pepper</li>
        <li>2 Clove Garlic, Minced</li>
    </ul>
<!--Important notes here. PS, hope religion jokes dont offend you.-->
    <h3>I got my ingredients. Now what?</h3>
    <p>Uh, I dunno. Mix em up and shape them into patties perhaps? <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/49404/juiciest-hamburgers-ever/" target="_blank">This Recipe</a>
    calls for making 8 patties out of this. Id honestly just go for 4 nice big boys. Also, consider adding Paprika, Diced Onion and some Tabasco Sauce to the mix. 
    And <strong>be forewarned.</strong> If your crack this recipe out at the next neighborhood BBQ, there a real chance the BBQ boys/girls may seriously envy you. And a real 
    chance their significant others may seriously covet you. Not that this is a bad thing per se, its just, 2 mortal sins at the BBQ-get-together is kinda rookie numbers. Any self respecting, 
    worldly individual should be going for 5 or more.</p>
