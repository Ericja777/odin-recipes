    <h2>Mr Noodles but a lot better, seriously.</h2>

    <p>So, Im willing to bet most of us are very well acquainted with the good old college kid special: Mr Noodles. But, did you know 
    if you add an egg to that, it makes them a lot better? Seriously, just crack an egg and toss it in there (sans shell, duh). Go fourth my child, 
    and spread this wisdom to the world.
    <br>
    <p>Yeah, thats it. All I got for this one. Oh, try some spices too, if you dont already. Really revolutionizes the stuff.</p>
